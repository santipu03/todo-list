### Live Demo ###

### Built With ###
 - HTML5
 - CSS
 - Vanilla Javascript
 - Webpack
 - Date


 ## Functionality ##
  - Create tasks and assign projects to them, or not. 
  - Set the due date for each task and the web will show you:
        - if the date has passed
        - if the date was for yesterday
        - if the date is today
        - if the date is for tomorrow
        - if the date has to come in the future
  - Set a priority mark for the task and click the priority tab to preview all the priority tasks
  - Click the edit button in each task to view it's details and change them or remove the task if you want. 
  - In the aside, you can see the tasks with a due date for Today or for This Week. You can also create projects and see the tasks assigned to each one of them. 
  - All tasks and projects are stored in the localStorage so all the changes you do will apear when you reload the page.
  - There are 3 default tasks and 2 default projects that are always there, if you edit them the changes will be updated correctly but if you delete them they'll appear in the new reload because they're default. 


#### Feature ideas to implement: ####
 - Responsive Design
 - Style every task with border color by project
 - Migrate to React.js framework
